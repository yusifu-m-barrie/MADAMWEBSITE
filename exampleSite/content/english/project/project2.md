**THE SKILLS TRAINING AND ENTERPRISE DEVELOPMENT FOR YOUTHS (STEDY)** project has three components combined to provide various Technical & Vocational Education Training (TVET) to youths. The Entrepreneurship Skills Training and Advocacy Components contributes to mitigating skills gap in the middle-level manpower to make youths with technical skills Job-creators and not Job-seekers.

Technical and Vocational Training is only a means and not an end to job creation and employment promotion. In order to optimise youth access to TVET institutions, capacity building and self-employment, the Regional network of TVET Institutions (NetVET) engages in lobbying and advocacy at regional and national platforms.
