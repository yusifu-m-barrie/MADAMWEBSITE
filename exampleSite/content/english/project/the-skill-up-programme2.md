## THE SKILL UP! PROGRAMME

The Skill Up! programme is funded by BMZ (the German Federal Ministry for Economic Cooperation and Development) and is a skill development programme aimed at addressing the growing problem of youth unemployment through focusing on skill-based training as well as job linkages. The Skill Up! programme aims at the implementation of the Skill Up! approach to enhance the quality and relevance of (non-formal) technical and vocational education and training (TVET) at multiple political levels by strengthening local partner organizations and networking at macro level. As a result, the living conditions (livelihood) and prospects of young, vulnerable people in African and Asian countries have been sustainably improved through the provision of job-related skills and the strengthening of entrepreneurship. The objective is to improve the employability and entrepreneurial ability of vulnerable young people to boost their chances of earning a decent income and improving their quality of life and that of their families. The Skill Up! programme encompasses eight (8) countries: four in Africa; Kenya, Malawi, Sierra Leone, Uganda and another four countries in Asia; Afghanistan, India, Nepal and Tajikistan with expected project duration from 2019 –2023.

In Sierra Leone, the title of the project is: **“Skill Up! Strengthening skills development, creating future perspectives: Sierra Leone”**

The overall goal of the project in Serra Leone is: **Improved living conditions (livelihood) of young men and women in Sierra Leone through the establishment of non-formal TVET (Technical Vocational Education and Training) structures.**

The project has a target of 3,000 vulnerable young men and women living in rural and peri-urban areas in Sierra Leone with a thirty-four-month life cycle

The operational areas of the project in the country include: Bombali & Karene Districts (North), Bo District (South), Kenema District (East), Western Area Rural and Urban (West) and Port Loko.

Man power development in developing countries including Sierra Leone mostly targets the formal sector with the ultimate aim of catering for white-collared jobs. The non-formal sector, whose constituents are in the majority and mostly live in rural and peri-urban areas is often neglected, ignored or not accorded the attention or importance it deserves. Ironically however, this is the sector that has the potential to contribute immensely to job creation and overall economic growth.

In Sierra Leone, the Skill Up! project has come as an avenue to bridge the gap between formal education and the non-formal TVET, creating training opportunities for young men and women in the non-formal sector with the aim of empowering them with marketable skills for small and medium enterprise development

The first/pilot phase of the project ended officially in September 2020 and the second phase commenced thereafter with greater coverage and involvement in terms of participants.

With barely four months of its taking off, enough ground has already been covered in the following areas: recruitment of all project staff, acquisition of project logistics, signing of MOUs with implementing partner organizations, establishment of collaboration and cooperation pacts with government Ministries, Departments and Agencies (to give accreditation to the project’s activities) and Associate Partner Institutions (APIs) and setting the framework for full implementation of the project.
